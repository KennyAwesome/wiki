<!-- TITLE: How to use this wiki -->

# Content Structure

Currently, this wiki is mainly used to preserve and share knowledge and experiences. Most knowledge and experience relates to a specific **tool/machine** or **technique**.

Only **tool-specific** knowledge goes to the "tool page" (eg. /tools/othermill). If it's **general knowledge on the technique**, it goes to the respective "skill page" (/skills/electronics/pcb-milling or /skills/cnc-milling in the othermill example).

# Tool Pages

When creating a new tool page, please use the template located under [/meta/templates/tool-page](/meta/templates/tool-page). Open up the template, click on *edit*, copy the entire source code, and paste it to your new page. If you feel that the template is missing something, or has something in excess - change it!

# Documentation

This wiki is built using [wiki.js](https://wiki.js.org/) running inside [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) on a [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) VM hosted on [Scaleway](https://www.scaleway.com/). It uses [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for content that is persisted in the corresponding [GIT](https://git-scm.com/) [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/erfindergarden/wiki).

> **Note:** If you can pack more weblinks in a text of the same length as the above (measured in characters) and justify each of them, you get a free beer next time we meet. Exception: Extending the above phrases with links for (wiki, VM, hosting, content, persistance, correspondence) does not count
