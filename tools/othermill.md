Otherplan can be used  as a generic G-Code sender for the Othermill, but also as a CAM solution for PCB milling. For the latter, it takes up to three  Gerber files (top traces, bottom traces, outline) plus one NC Drill file (for the holes) and generates toolspaths from them, based on the tools you select inside the application.

# Maintenance

Please refer to the official [Maintenance Guide](https://othermachine.co/support/techniques/maintenance/).

Every once in a while, when time has left its marks on the spoilboard, it might be necessary to smoothen it. There are also official instructions on how to do that: [Facing the Spoilboard](https://othermachine.co/support/techniques/facing-spoilboard/).
